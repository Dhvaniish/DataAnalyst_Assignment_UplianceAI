# User Behavior and Order Trends Analysis
This repository contains the analysis of user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends based on three datasets: UserDetails, CookingSessions, and OrderDetails. The project involves cleaning and merging data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating visualizations, and drafting actionable business recommendations.

üìÇ Project Overview
Objectives
  + Analyze datasets to understand user behavior and order trends.
  + Identify popular dishes, spending patterns, and demographic influences.
  + Provide actionable recommendations for enhancing user engagement and business growth.
Datasets
  1. UserDetails: Demographic and preference information of users.
  2. CookingSessions: Details of cooking sessions, including session ratings and dishes prepared.
  3. OrderDetails: Order information such as meal types, dish names, order status, and user ratings.

üõ†Ô∏è Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Merging
  + Identified and handled missing values.
  + Ensured no duplicates across datasets.
  + Merged datasets using User ID and Session ID for a comprehensive analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  + Popular dishes and meal preferences.
  + Average spending trends by meal type, location, and age.
  + Correlation analysis between cooking session ratings and order ratings.
3. Visualizations
  + Monthly order trends.
  + Spending by location and meal type preferences.
  + Age-based spending patterns.
  + Correlation heatmap for session and order ratings.
4. Business Recommendations
